        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Launch Netbeans and create a Java Application project
            named <b>Lab8</b>
            that is located in your H:\CSC120\Java folder.<br />
            <br />

		    <ol type="a">
			    <li>If your <b>Lab6</b> was fully implemented having the
                    RoundHeads move horizontally, then open your your <b>Lab6</b> project
                    in NetBeans, copy all of the files from the src folder, and
                    paste them into the src folder of your new <span style="font-weight:
                    bold;">Lab8 </span>project.<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>If your <b>Lab6</b> project is not working or you didn't
                    completely implement at least the move horizontally stuff, then right-click
                    on the following file and save it:
					<blockquote>
		               <a href="Lab8StarterFiles.zip"> Lab8StarterFiles.zip</a>
		            </blockquote>
                    Unzip and Extract All of the files, and copy <b><u>ALL FOUR</u></b>
					of the files you unzipped into the src folder of your project.<br/><br/>
			    </li>
			</ol>
            The starting point for Lab8 is a working version of the
            Lab6 code
            with the <code>RoundHead</code> objects.&nbsp; 
            Run the new project to make sure that things are working
            before
            proceeding.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>Edit the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file, and inspect the code
            to find all declarations, instantiations and uses of the <code>RoundHead</code>
            objects "firstOne", "secondOne", etc.<br />
            <br />
            Remove the declarations of separate, individual <code>RoundHead</code>
            objects, and in their place, declare an array of <code>RoundHead</code>s
            called <code>rhArray</code>.
<b><pre>
    private RoundHead[] rhArray;
</pre></b>
            In the <code>MUPanel</code> constructor method, replace the
            instantiations of the separate <code>RoundHead</code>
            objects, and
            instead instantiate <code>rhArray</code> so that it contains
            19
            elements. Then, write a loop that will be repeated once for
            each
            element in the array.
<b><pre>
    rhArray = new RoundHead[???];

    for (Integer index = 0; index &lt; rhArray.length; index++) {

        rhArray[index] = new RoundHead( ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? );
	
    } // end of for loop
</pre></b>
            The body of this loop should instantiate <i>one</i> member
            of the <code>rhArray</code>
            array, using these parameter values: <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li> the RoundHead should be HAPPY.&nbsp; This means use <b>true</b>
                as the boolean parameter value in the constructor call.
              </li>
              <li> the RoundHead's hat should be RED. </li>
              <li> over should be a formula that computes 30 times the <b>loop control
                variable</b>.</li>
              <li> down should be a formula that computes 20 times the <b>loop control
                variable</b>.</li>
              <li> the verticalStepSize should be 15.</li>
              <li> the horizontalStepSize should be 10.</li>
              <li> the size should be 25</li>
              <li> the nickName should be "Sammy"<br />
                <br />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Don't forget to modify the methods in the <code>MUPanel</code> class
		    that ask RoundHeads to
            move, change their mood, and draw themselves. In each of
            these methods
            in the <code>MUPanel</code> class, add a <code>for</code>
            loop
            to call the appropriate method for each <code>RoundHead</code>
            object
            in the <code>rhArray</code> array. Run this program and
            observe the
            results.&nbsp; The output should show 19 roundheads in a diagonal
            line, and
            they should move, change moods and bounce off walls
            correctly.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>What if we don't want EVERY RoundHead to be Happy with a
            red
            hat?&nbsp; We can choose different values for each RoundHead
            in the
            array when it is constructed, as follows:&nbsp; inside the loop
            in the <code>MUPanel</code>
            constructor method where we instantiate new <code>RoundHead</code>
            objects, as the FIRST line in the loop body, declare a <strong>Boolean</strong> variable called
            <code>isHappy</code>.&nbsp;
            If
            the
            loop control variable is an EVEN NUMBER, store the value <b>true</b>
            in <code>isHappy</code>; else, store <b>false</b> in <code>isHappy</code>.&nbsp;

Then
replace
the
            <b>true</b> in the constructor call with <code>isHappy</code>.&nbsp;
			The constructor call must be the LAST statement inside the for loop body.&nbsp;
Recompile
and
run
            the program.&nbsp; Did it work? <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li> Change the program so that the first and last
            RoundHeads have a GREEN hat.&nbsp; Run the program to verify that the
			first and last elements in the array have different colored hats.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li> Change the program so that if the loop control variable is less than 12, the RoundHeads in the 
		    index position in the array
		    is instantiated with a size of 20, and the ones in positions that are not less than 12 are initially
			30 pixels in size.&nbsp; Run the program to verify that your changes were made correctly.<br />

		  <li> Declare a new RoundHead object named "Fred" in MUPanel.java, and instantiate Fred so that he is happy with
		       a CYAN hat, is 60 pixels in size, moves 25 pixels horizontally and vertically, and is located at the start of 
			   the program in the bottom-left corner of the screen somewhere.&nbsp; Be sure to draw Fred in the
			   <code>paintComponent</code> method.
		  </li>
		  <li> <p>Add two new methods to MUPanel.java, as follows.&nbsp; The first method is named "moveFred", and it is a void
		       method that accepts no parameters.&nbsp; In the <code>moveFred</code> method, call the <code>moveVertically</code> method and
			   also the <code>moveHorizontally</code> method for the fred object.&nbsp; The second method is named "changeFredsMood", and
			   it also is a void method that accepts no parameters.&nbsp; The <code>changeFredsMood</code> method should call the
			   <code>changeMood</code> method for the fred object.
		  </li>
		  <li> <p>Switch to MUFrame.java in the editor, and change to "Design" mode.&nbsp; Add two new buttons to the interface, one
		       labeled "Move Fred" and the other named "Change Fred's Mood".&nbsp; The actionPerformed methods for these two
			   buttons should call the appropriate methods of the muPanel object that you wrote in the previous instruction, and then
			   ask muPanel to repaint().&nbsp; Test the program now, and the new buttons should cause Fred to move or change mood 
			   while the other RoundHeads remain stationary.
		  </li>
		  <li> <p>Now let's modify MUPanel so that the RoundHeads in the array move on the screen even if we aren't clicking the Move
		       Roundheads button.&nbsp; To do this, copy the following code and paste it into MUPanel.java right above the comment that says,
			   "Don't change anything below here":
<pre>
    private volatile Thread animator;
    private Integer animationDelay = 200;
 
    public void start() {
        if (animator == null) {
            animator = new Thread(this);
            animator.start();
        } // end if
    } // end of start()

    public void stop() {
        animator = null;
    } // end of stop()
  
    public void run() {
        Thread thisThread = Thread.currentThread();
        while (animator == thisThread) {
            moveObjects();
            repaint();
			
            try { Thread.sleep(animationDelay); }
            catch (InterruptedException e) { }
        } // end while
    } // end of run()
	
</pre> 
      Next, modify the class heading for the MUPanel class so that it looks like this:
<pre>
public class MUPanel extends JPanel implements Runnable {

</pre>
      Then, switch to MUFrame and add two more buttons to the interface, one named "Start Animation" and
      the other named "Stop Animation".&nbsp; When the Start Animation button is clicked, you should call 
      <code>muPanel.start()</code>; when the Stop Animation button is clicked, you should call
      <code>muPanel.stop()</code>.&nbsp; Run the program, and try out the new buttons.&nbsp; 
	  Can you move Fred around the screen and avoid the marching RoundHeads?	  
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>If you would want the animation to start as soon as the program starts, there is a simple way
			to do that.&nbsp; In MUFrame.java, scroll to the end of the constructor method, and then right before the
			closing brace for the method, call the <code>muPanel.start()</code> method.&nbsp; The constructor
			is executed only once, when the program starts, and so the animation will begin right away instead
			of waiting for the user to click the Start Animation button.&nbsp; You should be able to stop
			and start the animation with the buttons as before.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>The variable named <code>animationDelay</code> specifies the delay that will be used between 
			repaintings, and is a number of milliseconds (thousandths of a second).&nbsp; You can make the animation
			effects happen faster by using a smaller number for the animation delay, or slow it down with a bigger 
			number for the delay.&nbsp;
			Try changing the value of <code>animationDelay</code> in MUPanel.java, using 500 (which is a &frac12; second delay), then
			try 100 (a tenth-of-a-second delay), and finally try 25 &mdash; that's really fast!&nbsp; Change the delay a final time to
			a value that you like.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>Add randomness to the instantiation of the RoundHead objects in your program
			   so that the horizontal and vertical movement factors used for each RoundHead in the array
			   is a random integer in the range from -30 to 30.&nbsp; Run the program and 
			   watch the RoundHeads break out of their initial positions unpredictably.
		  </li>
          <li>Write a <code>ShootingStar</code> class
            definition
            based on the <code>Star</code> class that draws something
            that looks
            like a shooting star, and then declare, instantiate and draw
            an array
            of 10 shooting stars.&nbsp; The shooting stars should be
            randomly
            placed in the output window, in a manner that is similar to
            the way the <code>Star</code>s were placed. </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>You could add a button or two to the interface to increase or decrease the <code>animationDelay</code>
			value to speed up or slow down the
			animation as it is running.&nbsp; To do that, you would need a <code>setAnimationDelay</code> method in MUPanel that could
			be called from the actionPerformed methods in MUFrame.&nbsp; Or maybe you would like to try a Spinner or a Slider
			for changing the animationDelay....
