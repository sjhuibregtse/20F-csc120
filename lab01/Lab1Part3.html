  <li>Watch 
      <a href="BalloonDemoLab1Part3.mp4" target="_blank">
	  this video,</a>
      which explains how to <b>declare, instantiate,</b> and <b>use</b> objects from an existing class.<br /><br /></li>

  <li>Create your Lab1 project:<br /><br />
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Create a new NetBeans project called Lab1.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Visit the <a href="../resources.html" target="_blank"> CSC 120 Resources</a> web page, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click on the link to <code><b>MUPanel.java</b></code> in the <b>Starter Templates</b> section of the page,<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose "Save Link As..." or "Save File As...",<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and save the file in your <b>CSC120\Java\Lab1\src</b> folder: <br /><br />
			<!--&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, switch to NetBeans, right-click on the file name <code><b>MUPanel.txt</b></code> in the tree in the left panel,<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose "Rename", and replace the ".txt" file extension with a ".java" file extension.<br /><br /-->
		</li>
        <li>Again on the <a href="../resources.html" target="_blank"> CSC 120 Resources</a> web page, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left-click on the link to <b>MU Java Classes</b> in the <b>JavaDocs and Java Classes</b> section at the bottom of the page,<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click on the link to <code><b>Flag.java</b></code> on the MU Classes page,<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose "Save Link As..." or "Save File As...",<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and save the file in your <b>CSC120\Java\Lab1\src</b> folder<br /><br />
			<!--&nbsp;&nbsp;Then switch to NetBeans, right-click on the file name <code><b>Flag.txt</b></code> in the tree in the left panel,<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rename the file "Flag.txt" to be "Flag.java".<br /><br /-->
        </li>
        <li>Before moving to the next step in this lab, be sure that your <code>Lab1</code> project contains two files in the <code><b>src</b></code>
		    folder that are named <code><b>Flag.java</b></code> and <code><b>MUPanel.java</b></code>.<br /><br />
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  
  <li>Declare a Flag object in the appropriate place in the MUPanel.java file, like this:<pre>
private Flag flag1;</pre>
  </li>
  
  <li>In the appropriate place in the MUPanel.java file instantiate (construct) your Flag object.
      To do this you'll need to know what parameters to pass to the constructor method of the Flag
      class. To find that out you can click on the MU Java Docs page for Balloon, Flag, etc.
      from the CSC 120 Resources page, and from there click on the docs for the Flag class.
      Now scroll down and find the description of the constructor method to see what parameters
      it expects. You'll need to add a line of code in the MUPanel.java file in the space
      where you instantiate objects. It should look something like this:
<pre>
flag1 = new Flag( <em>... parameters go here ...</em> );
</pre>
      There are 4 values that you must specify to instantiate a new Flag object:  you must first
	  specify 2 Integer values that represent the screen position of the upper-left corner of
	  the Flag, and then you specify two different Color values; one Color for the Flag's 
	  background, and a second Color for the horizontal stripe across the middle of the Flag.&nbsp; The
	  parameters in parentheses are always separated by commas.<br/><br/>
  </li>
  
  <li>Finally, in the paintComponent method of MUPanel, add a line of code that calls the
      draw method of your Flag object. Don't forget to pass it the Graphics object it expects.<br /><br />
  </li>
      
  <li>Now declare 3 more Flag objects, instantiate them, and ask them to draw themselves.
      Make sure your 4 Flag objects each use different flag & stripe color combinations,
      are in different locations, and are visible (not outside of the MUPanel window).&nbsp;
	  <a href="JavaColorNames.html" target="_blank"> Here is a list of color names</a> you can use
	  in Java. <br /><br /></li>
      
  <li>Change the String used in the "<code><b>setName</b></code>" method of the MUPanel constructor
	  so that your name replaces Samantha's in the title of the output window when the program is run.&nbsp; Next, edit
	  the comment header at the top of the MUPanel class to show your name
      and today's date instead of Samantha Student and the words "Today's Date". Finally, add a brief
      description of what your program does. <br /><br /></li>

  <li> Run your program so that the output window appears on your screen.&nbsp; Take a screen capture of just the output window that includes
       the title bar showing your name (in Windows, this can be done in one of two ways:<br/><br/>
	     <ol>
		     <li> Click on the output window so that it is selected, then use the [Alt]-[PrtSc] keystroke.&nbsp; Next, open Windows Paint (type
			      "Paint" in the Windows search area), paste in your screen capture, and save the image as a 
				  <code><b>.png</b></code> file </li><br/>
			 <li> Use the Windows Snip & Sketch tool (search for "Snip" in the Windows search area), then save your screen snip as a 
			      <code><b>.png</b></code> file</li>
		 </ol><br/>
		 Ask your 
	   lab instructor for help if needed with this process.&nbsp; You will save your screen capture as a <code><b>.png</b></code> file to be submitted along with
	   your NetBeans project.<br/><br/></li>	  
	  
  <li>Hand in your project by following these steps: <br/><br/>
      <ol type="a">
	    <li> Click on the &thinsp; <img src="WindowsExplorer.png" alt="file folder" /> &thinsp; icon at the bottom of the screen 
		     to open File Explorer, and browse to the 
		     location of your <b><code>CSC120\Java</code></b> folder.<br/><br/> </li>
		
	    <li> Right-click on the folder named <b><code>Lab1</code></b> and choose "Send To&thinsp; &#x25B6; &thinsp;Compressed (zipped) folder".&nbsp;
	         This will create a new file named <b><code>Lab1.zip</code></b> in the current folder, which is a compressed file that contains your
	         entire NetBeans project.<br/><br/> </li>
	  
	    <li> Use a web browser to <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank"> login to D2L</a>,
	         and go to the CSC 120 course in your course list.<br/><br/> </li>
		
	    <li> Choose "Assessments", then "Dropbox", and 
	         then click on the link to the "Lab01" dropbox folder.&nbsp; This will display the "Lab01 Submit Files" page,
	         and you will want to find the "Add a File" button about halfway down the page &mdash; click this button now.<br/><br/> </li>
		
	    <li> Click on the "Upload" button in the dialog window that appears, browse to your <b><code>CSC120\Java</code></b> folder,
   	         and select the file named "Lab01.zip".&nbsp; Click the blue "Add" button. <br/><br/> </li>
			 
	    <li> Click the "Upload" button again, and this time browse to the folder in which you saved your screen capture .png file.&nbsp; Select
		     that file and click the blue "Add" button. <br/><br/> </li>
			 
	    <li> Click the blue "Submit" button.&nbsp;
	         If you did this correctly, you should receive a "File submission successful" message in your browser.&nbsp; You will also receive
	         an e-mail message confirming that you submitted the files to the CSC 120 Lab01 dropbox.<br/><br/> </li>
	  </ol>
	  
	  If you have any questions about submitting work, ask your instructor for clarification or help.<br /><br /></li>

  <li><em>If time remains in this class period</em>, create a new NetBeans project called Lab1B that draws 3 
          differently-colored Flags
          at the same vertical position across the bottom part of the display window, with a Balloon 
		  located above each Flag.&nbsp; Each Balloon should be the same color as the central stripe on each
		  Flag.&nbsp; Show your results to your instructor if you are able to get this to work before the 
		  end of today's class session.&nbsp; You won't need to submit the Lab1B project to D2L.<br /><br /></li>
