<h1>CSC 120 <font color=#800080>Programming Style Guidelines </font></h1>
</center></font>

<H3>Programs that produce correct answers are not always sufficiently 
well-designed and/or readable to earn an "A" grade.&nbsp; It is vitally 
important in the computing profession to develop programs that can be easily 
read by a person that is knowledgeable in the programming language used who is not the
author of the code; in most 
professional environments, program source code must be able to be maintained by a 
person other than the author of the program.&nbsp; To foster good programming 
habits, the faculty of the CS department have agreed on the following 
guidelines for programs written to satisfy requirements for CSC 120 this 
semester.</H3>
<H4>In-Program Documentation:</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Concise, meaningful, well-formatted comments should be located at 
  key points in your program.&nbsp; Examples of commenting requirements will be 
  given throughout the semester, as our knowledge of Java expands.&nbsp; At a 
  minimum, all programs must contain a program heading comment that states 
  student name, assignment number, date that the program was completed and a 
  brief explanation of the purpose of the program.&nbsp; See the example 
  programs at the bottom of this page for a look at what we consider good and 
  bad documentation. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Programming Style:</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Code should be well-formatted, using the same indenting style 
  throughout the program.&nbsp; Blank lines should be used between important 
  portions of the program, to enhance readability.&nbsp; Object, variable and 
  method names should be meaningfully related to the problem being solved.&nbsp; 
  See your textbook or other Java sources to see what good program style looks 
  like.<BR><BR>Here are some programming conventions (rules of thumb) that will 
  make your programs easier to read, understand and maintain.&nbsp; By following 
  these conventions, you will eliminate many errors that are often made by 
  beginning students. 
  <UL>
    <LI>objects and variables should always be declared <EM>private</EM> 
    <LI>methods should be <EM>public</EM> 
    <LI>class names start with a capital letter 
    <LI>object, variable and method names start with a lower-case letter 
    <LI>names of constants should be capitalized (for example, <code>private final 
    static int ARRAY_SIZE = 25;</code>) 
    <LI>accessor methods should use names beginning with "<code>get</code>" and "<code>set</code>".&nbsp; 
    Examples include <code>getValue</code>, <code>getThing</code>, <code>setValue</code>, 
    <code>setObject</code>, etc. 
    <LI>it is helpful to always use curly braces <code>{}</code> to delimit a block of code 
    even if there is only one statement in the block.&nbsp; For example, <PRE>            if (num &gt; 10) {
                 x = num / 2;
            }
</PRE></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Example of Good Coding Style:</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We consider the following program to be written in a good 
  style.&nbsp; Note the effective use of comments (not too many, but enough to 
  identify the major operations of the program, and to explain the use of each 
  variable).&nbsp; Further note the consistent indenting style, the use of blank 
  lines to make the code more readable, etc.&nbsp; This program would receive 
  full credit for Documentation and Programming Style when graded. <PRE>         /*------------------------------------------*

<P>
<H4>Special note about closing braces ( the '}' character):</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some students in the past have adopted a habit of placing the 
  closing curly brace for a code block at the end of the last line in the block, 
  instead of on a separate line after the last line in the block.&nbsp; This has 
  proven to make a program <STRONG>VERY DIFFICULT</STRONG> to read, and so such 
  usage will result in a Programming Style deduction this semester.&nbsp; Here 
  is an example that shows the bad style usage of closing curly braces being 
  discussed in this paragraph: <PRE>         import java.awt.*;
         import javax.swing.*;
         import java.awt.event.*;
     
         public class MUPanel extends JPanel {

             private int x, y, z;                 
             private double avg;

             public MUPanel {
                 x = 14;
                 y = 19;
                 z = 22;}

             public void paintComponent ( Graphics g ) {
                 super.paintComponent(g);
				 
                 avg = (x + y + z) / 3.0; // force floating-point division

                 if (avg &lt; 10) {
                     System.out.println("Small average of "+avg);}
                 else if (avg &gt; 20) {
                     System.out.println("Large average of "+avg);}
                 else {
                     System.out.println("Medium average of "+avg);}}}         
</PRE>This program produces the correct output, but it is hard for a reader of 
  the program to tell which of the closing braces marks the end of the else 
  clause, the end of the paintComponent method, etc.&nbsp; Avoid this style in your 
  programming this semester. </BLOCKQUOTE>
