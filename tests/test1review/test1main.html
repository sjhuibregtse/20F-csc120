      <li>In the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the MUPanel class, write code that does the following:<br/><br/>
           <ol type="a">
		       <li> Fill a rectangle that is three times as wide as it is high, in whatever color you wish.<br/><br/></li>
			   <li> Next, change the drawing color, and then fill a square that is half as wide as the first
			        rectangle, and whose upper-left corner point is the lower-right corner point of the
					first rectangle.<br/><br/></li>
			   <li> Then change the drawing color to a third color that is different than the other two, and fill a 
			        circle that is half as high as the original rectangle, and touches the lower-left corner point
					of that rectangle at the middle-right point of the circle (the point on the circle that would
					be EAST on a compass, or 0 degrees if we think of a Java arc).<br/><br/></li>
			   <li>Your shapes should be touching as in this illustration:<br/><br/>
