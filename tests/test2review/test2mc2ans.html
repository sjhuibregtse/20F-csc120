	    <input type="radio" name="q2a" checked> <b> one = 5 and two = 3 </b> <br/>
	    <input type="radio" name="q2a"> None of these <br/>
	</blockquote>
	<b>Whenever a variable appears on the right-hand side of an assignment statement, Java always uses the
	   <em>most recent</em> value that has been stored in that variable.&nbsp; So in the last assignment
	   statement above, <code>two</code> has the new value 3, which is added to the value of <code>one</code>,
	   which is 2. <br/><br/>
