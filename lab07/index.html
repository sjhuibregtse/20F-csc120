<h2>CSC 120 Lab 7</h2>
</center>
</font>
<p>In this lab we will practice with <code><b>for</b></code> loops and drawing repetitive patterns with loops
<ol type="A">
  <li><b>Create a new NetBeans project called Lab7a, and copy source
files to it.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>File | New Project, etc. Make sure the Project Location is in
your CSC120\Java folder, and the Project Name is Lab7a. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
	  <li>Right-click on the following link and save this .zip file in your CSC120 folder:
	      <blockquote>
		      <a href="Lab7aStarterFiles.zip"> Lab7aStarterFiles.zip</a>
		  </blockquote></li>
      <li>Use Windows Explorer to Extract All from the .zip file you saved in the previous
          step, and then copy <b><u>BOTH</u></b> files that were extracted,
	      and paste them in the src folder of your project.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Run the program.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Run the program as it is given.&nbsp; Five lines are displayed in the Text Area
	      on screen.&nbsp; Then examine the program in "Source" view.&nbsp;Look at the
	      source code of the program -- there is only one <code>outputArea.append</code> statement inside the
		  <code>for</code> loop
		  (it is spread across several lines), which
		  is executed multiple times because of the loop in the program.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Make changes to the given program.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the value of the variable <code>down</code> take on the values 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 as the 
	      program is executed.&nbsp; Use the same type of code to do this as is used in the program to 
		  cause <code>over</code> take on a series of values.&nbsp; If you do this properly, the values
		  of <code>down</code> shown above will be printed in the Text Area on screen.&nbsp; 
		  Run your program and
		  see if you can obtain correct output.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Make the program print 20 lines of output in the Text Area.&nbsp; Run the program and count to make 
	      sure that 20 lines of output are printed.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Add code to change other variables.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Inside the body of the constructor method for the <code>MUFrame</code> class,
    	  declare two more <code>Integer</code>
          variables called <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>.<br>
		<br>
	  </li>
	  <li>Make these variables take
		  on the following values:&nbsp; <code>width</code> should start with 700, and repeatedly decrease
		  by 10 each time through the loop; <code>height</code> should start with 1, and double itself
		  each time through the loop.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
	  <li>Add code to the <code>outputArea.append</code> statement inside the loop so that all four 
	      variable values
	      are printed in the Text Area on one line, with appropriate labels preceding each numeric
		  value.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Run the program, test, and fix as needed.</b> <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Create a new NetBeans project called Lab7b, and copy source
files to it.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
	  <li>Close the current Lab7a project in NetBeans. <br>
	    <br>
	  </li>
      <li>Choose "File | New Project, etc." from the NetBeans top-level menu bar.&nbsp; Make sure 
	  the Project Location is in your CSC120\Java folder, and the Project Name is Lab7b. <br>
	    <br>
	  </li>
	  <li>Right-click on the following link and save this .zip file in your CSC120 folder:
	      <blockquote>
		      <a href="Lab7bStarterFiles.zip"> Lab7bStarterFiles.zip</a>
		  </blockquote></li>
      <li>Use Windows Explorer to Extract All from the .zip file you saved in the previous
          step, and then copy <b><u>ALL THREE</u></b> files that were extracted,
	      and paste them in the src folder of your project.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
	  <li> In NetBeans, open the file MUFrame.java, and in "Design" view, change the title of the frame
	       so that it displays your name instead of "Samantha Student".
	    <br><br>
	  </li>
      <li>Run the program as it is given.&nbsp; Notice that 7 blue bars are displayed in the output window.&nbsp; 
	      Examine the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file and make sure you understand why the pattern that is drawn shows up as
		  it does.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Draw patterns using loops.</b><br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Change the code in the given <code>MUPanel</code> so that the patterns that may be viewed
	      by clicking <a href="LoopyDrawings/Drawings.html" 
		  target="_blank"> THIS LINK</a>
	      are drawn in the output window.<br>
		<br>
	  </li>
	  <li>Keep changing the program from pattern to pattern as you go along -- you don't need to keep 
	      each version of the program in a separate NetBeans project (unless you want to do that). <br>
	    <br>
      </li>
	  <li>Hint:&nbsp; each trip through the loop, after all the drawing is done, changing the values
	                  of <code>over</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>width</code> and/or 
					  <code>height</code> will cause the next shape to be drawn differently the 
					  next time through the loop.&nbsp; What is changing in the pattern from
					  shape to shape?&nbsp; Those variables are what need to be changed inside
					  the loop body.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
	  <li>Hint:&nbsp; to make every other color (or every third color, etc.) change to a 
	      different color, you'll need to use the
	      <b>%</b> operation to calculate the remainder of a division problem.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
	  <li>Ask your instructor
		  for help with any pattern you have trouble generating with a loop.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><b>Submit your Lab7b project for grading.</b><br>
  <blockquote>
      Turn in ONLY the final version of the Lab7b project into 
	  the <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">
	  D2L dropbox</a> for this assignment.&nbsp; Be sure to submit a
	  screen capture of your final pattern along with the .zip file
	  of the entire NetBeans project for this part of the lab.
