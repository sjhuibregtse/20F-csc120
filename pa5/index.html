<h4> It is expected that each student will complete this assignment INDIVIDUALLY.</h4>

<h4> This assignment must be submitted to the PA5 D2L dropbox <b>before</b> noon on the due date.</h4>

<h3>Overview:</h3>

<blockquote>
Write a Java application that uses an array to represent a collection of at least 10
objects, and provides a user interface that gives a way to display information and/or
statistics about the objects.&nbsp; The program should declare and instantiate an array
of objects that keep information about something in the real world (such as Countries,
Books, Students, etc.), and then implement JButtons that will display information
from the array or statistics about the items in the array in a JTextArea.
</blockquote>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>

    <li>Think of some objects in the real world that have at least five properties that can
	    be represented as private data members in a class definition. Examples would be
		the <code>Book</code> class and the <code>Student</code> class from Lab9, and the
		<code>Country</code> class used in the sample video. <font size="+1">You
		may not use Books, Students or Countries for your project; you must think up some other
		class of objects to use for this assignment.</font> <br /><br /></li>
    
    <li>Write a Java class definition for the class you will use for this assignment. This class must
	    have at least five private data members, a constructor method, getter methods for each of
		the private data items, and a <code>toString()</code> method. You may also want to implement
		setter methods for each of the private data items, but setters are not required for this
		assignment.<br /><br /></li>

    <li>In the <code>MUFrame</code> class, declare an array of your objects, and then in the constructor
	    method of the <code>MUFrame</code> class, instantiate the array so that it contains at least
		10 elements.<br /><br /></li>

    <li>When you instantiate the objects in the array,
        you'll need to do them one at a time not in a loop.<br />
        For example,<pre>
    nation[0] = new Country(some parameter values go here);
    nation[1] = new Country(some parameter values go here);
    nation[2] = new Country(some parameter values go here);
    ...</pre></li>

    <li>The program must have a JButton that when clicked will display every element in the array on
	    a separate line in a JTextArea that is visible in the output window. Of course you must
		use a loop to do this.<br /><br /></li>

    <li>The program must have at least two JButtons that when clicked will use a loop to calculate
        either the sum, average, minimum or maximum of a numeric data member of each element of the
		array. For example, you might have a button that would find the average population of
		all <code>Country</code> objects in the array, and another that would find the minimum area
		of any <code>Country</code>. The information must be displayed in the JTextArea that is 
		visible in the output window.<br /><br /></li>

    <li>The program must have at least two JButtons that when clicked will use a loop to test each
	    element of the array for some property of a <code>String</code> data member, using the <b><code>
		.equals</code></b> method. Either count the number of array elements that have the property
		being tested, or display them in the JTextArea. In the example video, a button can be
		used to display only those countries that are located in Asia (continent.equals("Asia")).
        <br /><br /></li>

    <li>Look over your comment documentation, and especially make sure the
        MUFrame.java header comment describes the project well.<br /><br /></li>

    <li>Don't forget to document acknowledgements for any code you used
        from labs, book, instructors, etc., and help you received.<br /><br /></li>

    <li>As usual, make a .zip file from the entire PA5 folder from your CSC120 space
        and obtain a screen capture of your output window; submit those files to the PA5 Dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank"> D2L</a> before the
		due date.<br /><br />
    </li>

		
    </ol>
