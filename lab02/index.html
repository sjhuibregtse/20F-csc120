CSC 120 Lab 2
</font></h2>

In this lab we will:
<ul>
	<li>Practice drawing rectangles, ovals, lines, and arcs using methods of the <code>Graphics</code> class.</li>
	<li>Practice organizing objects in the viewer, specifying over & down coordinates, widths, heights, and arc-angles.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<ol type="A">

  <li><b>Examine the Java Graphics Tutorial on the CSC 120 Resources Page.</b><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Java provides basic drawing capabilities via methods defined for the Graphics class.<br /><br /></li>

        <li>Visit the <a href="GraphicsTutorial.jpg" target="_blank">Java Graphics Tutorial</a> page to
		    see examples of several of the most-commonly used drawing methods.&nbsp; We will use some of these
			methods in today's lab activity.<br /><br /></li>
	  </ol>
  </li>

  <li><b>Create a new NetBeans project called Lab2, using a special starter program that draws one rectangle.</b><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>In NetBeans choose File | New Project | Java Application, etc.<br /><br /></li>

        <li>Make sure the Project Location is in your H:\CSC120\Java folder,
            and the Project Name is <b>Lab2</b> (no spaces in Lab2).<br /><br /></li>

        <li>Right-click on the following link:&nbsp; <b><a href="MUPanel.java">MUPanel.java</a></b>, and
		    then choose <b>Save link as...</b>. Save this file in your Lab2 <b>src</b> folder. <!--Then in NetBeans,
			right-click on the file name <code>MUPanel.txt</code> and rename the file so that it has a <b>.java</b>
			file extension.-->
		    <br /><br /></li>

        <li>Double-click on the MUPanel.java file to edit it.
		    Look over the comment header at the top, and change the name and date to your name
            and today's date.<br /><br /></li>

        <li>Notice in the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the <b>MUPanel</b> class definition 
		    where we have used the <code>g.setColor</code> method to make the current drawing color be BLACK, and
			then used the <code>g.drawRect</code> method with parameters.<br /><br /></li>

        <li>Run the program to see what it does.<br /><br /></li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Edit the MUPanel.java file to finish the House.</b><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>We're going to use several more methods of the Graphics class to complete our house.
            We want the finished house to look approximately
            like <a href="FinishedHouse.png" target="_blank">this one</a>.<br /><br /></li>
            
        <li>In the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the MUPanel class, we will now add code to
		    draw the door and window for the house.&nbsp; It is  <font color="red"><b>strongly recommended</b></font> 
			that you draw a picture
            on paper and label coordinates & widths & heights to figure out values for your over, down, width, and height
            for your new rectangles. Use Color.BLUE for the color of the door and Color.YELLOW for the color of the window
            (the light is on in the room). <br /><br />
            Consult the Java 8 Class Documentation to learn about the 
			<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html#drawLine-int-int-int-int-"> drawLine</a>,
            <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html#drawRect-int-int-int-int-"> drawRect</a>,
			<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html#fillRect-int-int-int-int-"> fillRect</a>, and
   			<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html#fillOval-int-int-int-int-"> fillOval</a> methods.<br /><br /></li>

        <li>Notice that the window has a black border around the outside of the window &ndash; to produce this effect
		    in your program, you'll need to draw a BLACK rectangle after first filling a YELLOW rectangle for the window.
			<br /><br /></li>

        <li>Run the program, fix any errors that are noted, etc. until you get it to run properly, showing all three Rects
		    in the output window.<br /><br /></li>
		    
		<li>Use the <code>fillOval</code> method to paint an ORANGE Oval for the door knob,
		    and use the <code>drawLine</code> method to draw horizontal and vertical lines to divide the 
			window into panes,
		    and to draw two diagonal lines for the roof.&nbsp;  Make all of the lines BLACK.<br /><br /></li>

        <li>Run the program, fix any errors that are noted, etc. until you get it to run properly, and your house looks
            approximately like <a href="FinishedHouse.png" target="_blank">this one</a>.<br /><br /></li>
      </ol>
  </li>

  <li><b>Make a tree for the yard, and a happy-face sun for the sky.</b><br /><br />
      <ol>
	    <li>We want the finished picture to look approximately
            like <a href="FinishedPicture.png" target="_blank">this one</a>.<br /><br /></li>
            
	    <li>Use methods from the Graphics class to fill a brown rectangle and a GREEN oval to make the tree.&nbsp;
    		For brown instead of using Color.WHATEVER
	        use <b>new Color(102, 51,0)</b>, which will create a new color. So, this line of code looks something like this:<br />
	        <code>g.setColor( new Color(102, 51, 0) );</code><br/><br/>
	        Aside: If you want to create other colors that are not "built-in" to Java, use this link to the
			<a href="http://html-color-codes.com/rgb.html" target="_blank"> Decimal RGB Color Codes</a> web page,
                which shows a color palette
	        with numbers for the RGB (red-green-blue) values to pass to the Color constructor.<br /><br /></li>
	        
	    <li>Use a YELLOW Oval, two ORANGE Ovals, and one ORANGE Arc to make a happy-face sun.&nbsp; 
		    Consult the Java 8 Class Documentation to learn about the 
			<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html#drawArc-int-int-int-int-int-int-"> drawArc</a> method.
			<br /><br /></li>
	    
        <li>Run the program, fix any errors that are noted, etc. until you get it to run properly, and your picture looks
            approximately like <a href="FinishedPicture.png" target="_blank">this one</a>.<br /><br /></li>
      </ol>

<!--
  <li><b>Convert the sun into a separate class, and use a sun object in the program.</b><br /><br />
      <ol>
	    <li>Since the sun is made up of a big oval, two smaller ovals for the eyes and an arc for the mouth,
		    if we want to have lots of suns in our program, the best approach is to create a new <b>Sun</b> 
			class and then declare several Sun objects -- it cuts down on the number of Ovals and Arcs in the
			main program, and is easier to organize.&nbsp; Let's see how to do this.<br /><br /></li>
	        
	    <li>Right-click on the <b>src</b> folder in the project tree in the "Files" pane on the left side
		    of the NetBeans IDE, and choose "New | Java Class..." from the pop-up window.&nbsp; Use the
			name "SmileySun" for the Class Name and click "Finish".&nbsp; A new, empty class file named
			<em>SmileySun.java</em> has been added to your project, and the file is now in an editor
			window for you to work with.<br /><br /></li>

	    <li>Copy the following code and paste it into <em>SmileySun.java</em> replacing the current 
		    contents.&nbsp; This gives you the structure of a typical class definition to work with in this
			part of the lab.&nbsp; You could have typed this yourself, but this starter framework is given
			to you as a convenience.

import java.awt.*;

public class SmileySun {

    
    
    
    // constructor method
    public SmileySun () {
        
    } // end of constructor
    
    
    public void draw( Graphics g ) {
        
    } // end of draw()
    
} // end of class SmileySun
</pre>			
			</li>

	    <li>We will now cut all of the code that was used to draw the sun in the original 
		    program out of the <b>MUPanel</b> class and paste it into the <b>SmileySun</b> class.&nbsp;
			First of all, highlight all of the DECLARATIONS in <b>MUPanel</b> for the objects that
			make up the sun (that would be three <b>Oval</b>s and an <b>Arc</b>), cut them out of the
			code, and paste them into the <b>SmileySun</b> class at the top of the class definition where
			declarations are placed.&nbsp; Next, move the INSTANTIATIONS of these four objects from the
			<b>MUPanel</b> constructor to the constructor method of <b>SmileySun</b>.&nbsp; Finally, 
			move the code that DRAWS the four objects from the <code>paintComponent</code> method of 
			<b>MUPanel</b> into the <code><b>draw</b></code> method of <b>SmileySun</b>.
			<br /><br /></li>

	    <li>In <b>MUPanel</b>, DECLARE a <b>SmileySun</b> object named <b><code>theSun</code></b> in
		    the proper place for all declarations, INSTANTIATE <b><code>theSun</code></b> with an
			empty parameter list (an empty set of parentheses), and USE the <code>draw</code> method
			of <b><code>theSun</code></b> to draw the object in the <code>paintComponenet</code>
			method.<br /><br /></li>

	    <li>Run the program, and it should look the same as it did before, but notice that the 
		    <b>MUPanel</b> class is a little simpler, because we are working with one <b>SmileySun</b>
			object, not four different objects that together make up the sun.<br /><br /></li>
      </ol>
  </li>

  <li><b>Add two more SmileySun objects to your program.</b><br /><br />
      <ol>
	    <li>The real advantage of writing our own classes is that we can have multiple objects from the
		    classes in our programs.&nbsp; DECLARE two more <b>SmileySun</b> objects at the proper
			place in <b>MUPanel</b>, INSTANTIATE them in the constructor method, and USE the
			<code>draw</code> method of each object in the <code>paintComponent</code>.&nbsp;
			Run the program now &mdash; hey wait, how come there aren't three suns in the picture? <br/><br/>

			We have three <b>SmileySun</b> objects in our program, but each of them draws itself in
			the exact same screen location (so each one is on top of the others).&nbsp; We need to change
			the class definition to add property variables to the <b>SmileySun</b> objects so that each
			one knows its screen location, and can therefore be drawn in different spots on the screen.<br /><br /></li>
	        
	    <li>At the top of the <b>SmileySun</b> class definition, where the three <b>Oval</b>s and the
		    <b>Arc</b> are declared, DECLARE two <b><code>int</code></b> variables, one named <code>over</code>
			and the other named <code>down</code>.&nbsp; We are giving the SmileySun the knowledge of where
			it is located on the screen by having it remember the coordinates of a <em>reference point</em>
			for itself.<br /><br /></li>

	    <li>The key idea of this lab is that the simple shapes that make up the parts of the SmileySun
		    object should NOT be created with numbers for their screen locations, but should be created
			with screen position CALCULATIONS
            that are relative to the <em>reference point</em> of the SmileySun.&nbsp; Let's assume that the
            SmileySun below was created with the code shown at the right of the drawing:<br/>
            <img src="SmileySunWithBoundingRect01.png"> <br/>			
		    If we use fixed numbers for the screen locations of the <b>Oval</b>s and <b>Arc</b>, each sun
			is forced to be located in the same position.&nbsp; What we need to do is to change the instantiations
			of the pieces of our SmileySun so that their locations are relative to the reference point.&nbsp; 
			For our example, we would have this code: <br/>
            <img src="SmileySunWithBoundingRect02.png"> <br/>			
			To make this change, we need to be able to pass in the values of <code>over</code> and 
			<code>down</code> when we make a new <b>SmileySun</b> object, so that different ones can
			be in different positions.&nbsp; To do this, change the heading of the constructor
			method of the <b>SmileySun</b> class to be this:
<pre>
    // constructor method
    public SmileySun ( int x, int y ) {
</pre>
			Then paste in these two lines so that they are the first two lines in this method:
<pre>
    over = x;
    down = y;
</pre>		
			Finally, change the instantiations of the <b>Oval</b>s and the <b>Arc</b> in the
			<b>SmileySun</b> constructor method so that they use calculations based on <code>over</code>
			and <code>down</code> to position the shapes.<br /><br /></li>
			
	    <li>Now that you've changed the <b>SmileySun</b> constructor method, your program won't run until
		    you change the way you are instantiating the three <b>SmileySun</b> objects in <b>MUPanel</b>.&nbsp;
			In each of the instantiations of <b>SmileySun</b> objects, add two numbers as parameter values, and
			make sure that the values cause the suns to be located in non-overlapping screen positions.&nbsp;
			Then run your program, and show your results to your instructor.<br /><br /></li>
