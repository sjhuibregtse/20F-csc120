</font>
<h4> Note:&nbsp;You should <b>not</b> work on this assignment during
lecture or lab class-time unless:
<ol type="a">
  <li>You have completed all of the in-class assigned work for the day,
and</li>
  <li>You have permission from the instructor.</li>
</ol>
</h4>
<!--h4> This assignment must be handed in to your instructor's handin
folder <b>before</b> the beginning of class on the due date. </h4-->
<h3> Overview: </h3>
<blockquote> Develop a Java Application program that draws a visual
scene in the graphical output window. &nbsp;Your application must
declare, instantiate and draw at least TWO (2) objects from each of TWO
(2) different classes that represent visual objects (in other words,
the classes must have a <code>draw</code> method that can be called
from the <code>MUPanel</code> class).&nbsp; The two classes must draw
two different-looking things on the screen, and each object must be
drawn in a different screen location.&nbsp; Additionally, the student's
name must be displayed somewhere in the output window using the <code>drawString</code>
method of the <code>Graphics</code> class.&nbsp; Details of this
assignment and links to several example output screens appear below. <br>
  <br>
In effect, this assignment is quite similar to the Boat lab that we've worked on 
recently; with the
requirement that two different-looking classes are written by the
student, and at least two objects from each of the classes is drawn on
the screen.
</blockquote>

<h3> Instructions and Requirements: </h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create an application called <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA1
    </span>(no
spaces in the name, so <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA1</span>,
not <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA 1</span>).&nbsp; It should
have the classes <code>MUPanel</code>, <code>ThingOne</code> and <code>ThingTwo</code>
in
the files <b>MUPanel.java</b>, <b>ThingOne.java</b>
and <b>ThingTwo.java</b>,
respectively.&nbsp; To get started, you can use the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file
from previous labs you've worked on in Java (Lab1, for example), and you should 
right-click on the following two links and save the files in the <b>src</b> folder
of your <b>PA1</b> project: <br/>
    <ul>
	  <li> <a href="ThingOne.txt"> ThingOne.java</a> </li>
	  <li> <a href="ThingTwo.txt"> ThingTwo.java</a> </li>
	</ul>
    </p>
	<p>Note:&nbsp; you should change the names <code>ThingOne</code> and <code>ThingTwo</code> to
	names that are more meaningful for your project.&nbsp; As an example, good names for the classes used in
	Example Two shown at the end of this
	assignment description would be <code>Hummingbird</code> and <code>Flower</code>.
	</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
      <p>You may NOT use a class that has been used in previous labs or class examples for this assignment.&nbsp;
	     So you may not have Balloons, Flags, SmileySuns, LollipopTrees, Boats, etc.&nbsp; You are to make up your own
		 visual objects and develop class definitions for your items.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>In the <code>MUPanel </code>class, you must DECLARE two or
more private objects of type <code>ThingOne</code>, and also
DECLARE two or more objects of 
type <code>ThingTwo</code>.&nbsp; As an illustration, the first link
in the Examples section
below shows a program that declares five (5) objects from a <code>ThingOne</code> class that draws
a Pine Tree, and two (2) objects
from a <code>ThingTwo</code> class that draws a Snowman.
    <br>
    <br>
INSTANTIATE all of these objects inside the <code>MUPanel </code>constructor
method.
    <br>
    <br>
In the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the <code>MUPanel</code>
class, each
of the objects should be "asked" to draw themselves, by calling
each object's <code>draw</code> method. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> In the <code>paintComponent</code> method, use the <code>g.drawString</code>
method to draw a text string somewhere in the output window with a
message that includes your name.&nbsp; Examine the examples below to
see how this can be done, and what might be acceptable. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>ThingOne</code> and <code>ThingTwo</code> classes that will represent the 
	visual things in the
scene MUST each
have data members of
type <code>Integer</code> called <code>anchorX</code> and <code>anchorY</code>.
They
may
have
other data members, too, representing different sizes, colors or other
aspects of the individual
objects.&nbsp; In the starter files that are given with this assignment, 
the <code>ThingOne</code> class has six data members (some of which you might not use) that are
given to you as an example, and the <code>ThingTwo</code> class has no data members given
to you.&nbsp; In the first example below, the 
class that draws the Snowmen has a <code>hatColor</code>
data member of type <code>Color</code>, in addition to <code>anchorX</code>
and <code>anchorY</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>ThingOne</code> and <code>ThingTwo</code> classes MUST each have
a constructor method to
initialize all properties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>ThingOne</code> and <code>ThingTwo</code> classes MUST each have
a <code>draw </code> method that
accepts a parameter of type <code>Graphics</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All drawing done by the <code>draw</code> method of these
classes should be
relative to one fixed point referenced by the <code>anchorX</code> and <code>anchorY</code>
properties. For
instance you might use something like <br>
    </p>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">g.drawRect(anchorX + 25, anchorY + 50, width, height);</pre>
    <p> rather than something like</p>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">g.drawRect(125, 250, width, height);</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must use at least four (4) different drawing colors, and at
least four (4)
different drawing methods of the <code>Graphics</code> class (not
counting <code>setColor</code>) in the <code>draw</code> methods
of the <code>ThingOne</code> and <code>ThingTwo</code> classes.&nbsp; For example <code>drawRect</code>, <code>fillRect</code>,
    <code>drawOval</code>, <code>fillOval</code>, <code>drawArc</code>,
    <code>fillArc</code>, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must NOT use any of the shape-drawing or shape-filling methods of the <code>Graphics</code> class
	in the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the MUPanel class, with the exception of the <code>g.drawString</code> method call that will
	cause your name to be displayed in the output window.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3> Hints: </h3>
  <blockquote>
    Look <a href="PA1Hints.html" target="_blank"> here</a> for some helpful hints.
  </blockquote>
  
<h3> Enhancements: </h3>
<blockquote>
    This assignment includes the requirement to add at least two extra visual features over and above
	the base requirements that make the output of the program more fun,
    interesting, or surprising.&nbsp; Use your creativity and have fun with your 
	drawings!&nbsp; Here are some suggestions for things you could do as enhancements:
    <ol type="a">
	<li> One possible enhancement would be to define your own colors
(in
addition to the standard ones
that are part of the <code>Color</code> class). To do this, you can
use the
following method call:
        <blockquote> <code> g.setColor( new Color( <font
 color="#990000"><em>red</em></font>, <font color="#009900"><em>green</em></font>,
          <font color="#000099"><em>blue</em></font>) ); </code>
        </blockquote>
where the three parameters shown above represent the intensities of
the red, green,
and blue components of your chosen color, respectively. Each parameter
must be an integer
number between 0 and 255. How do you know the three
primary color components of some shade you want to use (such as
turquoise)? Visit
the <a href="http://html-color-codes.com/rgb.html" target="_blank">VisiBone Color Lab</a> <!--a href="http://visibone.com/colorlab" target="_blank">VisiBone Color Lab</a-->
 to
choose a color (the numbers shown diagaonally in each box give the red, green and blue values
you should use when creating a new Color, in order from top-left to bottom-right).&nbsp;
As an example, to draw using a light shade of yellow, use the following
Java method call: <code>
g.setColor(&nbsp;new&nbsp;Color(&nbsp;255,&nbsp;255,&nbsp;153&nbsp;)&nbsp;);
        </code></li><br/>
	  <li>You could define an additional class or two to go along with <code>ThingOne</code>
	      and <code>ThingTwo</code> to add other shapes or visual items to your scene as
		  an enhancement.
      </li>	  <br/>
      <li>Another possible enhancement could be using an irregular
polygon
(see the <a href="../../../../howDoI/PolygonDemo/PolygonDemo.html">Polygon Demo page</a> on the 
departmental <em><b>How do I...?</b></em>
pages).</li> <br/>
      <li> Yet another possible enhancement would be to use a different
        <code>Font</code> when you draw the string in the output
window.&nbsp; The first two examples below use a different font than
the default Java setting.&nbsp; Look up the <code>Font</code> class in
the Java Class Documentation. 
See the <a href="../../../../howDoI/FontDemo/FontDemo.html">Font Demo page</a> on the 
departmental <em><b>How do I...?</b></em>
pages for an example of how to do this.
</li> 
    </ol>
You must document your enhancements by adding comment lines at the
top of your program in <b>MUPanel.java</b> after your CSC 120, name,
etc, comments. Your comments should explain what you did for your
enhancements.

 </blockquote>
 
 <h3> Turning in your Program for Grading: </h3>
<blockquote>
  When you have completed your NetBeans project for PA1 (including the comment header at
  the top of the MUPanel.java file with your name, etc.), run the program and obtain a screen capture of
  the output window, and be sure to include the frame of the window showing your name in the title.&nbsp; 
  Then, use File Explorer to make a
  .zip file of the entire <b>PA1</b> folder in your
<b>H:\CSC120\Java</b> folder so that the file is named <b>PA1.zip</b>.&nbsp; Upload
the .zip file and the .png screen capture file to the PA1 dropbox 
in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.
