  <h2>First-Year Students:  Complete this request form for storage on the Mount Union Network</h2>  
<p>Mount Union students can have a personal storage space on the Mount Union network that can be used to store files, documents, programs, etc.&nbsp; We encourage you to use this space as it is a convenient way to store your work for CSC 120 and other courses. Starting with the Fall 2020 semester, incoming students must apply for this storage space by filling out a form.&nbsp; You should do this right away so that you can have this space for your work as soon as possible after the semesters starts.</p>
<p>If you are a returning student who entered Mount Union prior to Fall 2020, you do not have to apply for storage; this policy only applies to students who enter after the Spring 2020 semester.</p>
<p>If you are a new First-Year student, <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=eq9gHK7OOUy1dEXShMAl0_LywaWJgBxCg2u8CC30yKtUN1FPRlA5RldUNURPSENRMUFLNjdDSVpUMiQlQCN0PWcu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click this link and submit the form</a> for storage on the Mount Union network:&nbsp;</p>
