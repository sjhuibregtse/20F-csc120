  <h2>Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to access the CS Virtual Desktop from off-campus</h2>
  
  <h3> 
      Any computer connected to the Mount Union network can access the CS Virtual Desktop using a web browser.&nbsp; So if you have your own computer and are on campus, or if you use a computer in one of the labs on campus, you can directly access the CS Virtual Desktop using <a href="accessCSVDI.html" target="_blank"> these instructions</a>.<br/><br/>
	  
	  If you are using a computer that is off-campus and therefore not connected to the Mount Union network, you can connect to the campus with a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, connection, and then use a browser to connect to the CS Virtual Desktop.&nbsp; If you live off campus or commute to Mount Union, this gives you a way to access the course resources and campus network from home.<br/><br/>
	  
	  If you wish to set up a VPN connection, there are several steps that must be completed:<br/><br/>
	  
	  <ol>
	     <li> You must first apply to IT for the right to use such a connection.&nbsp; Only users who have an academic need will be authorized to use a VPN connection, and as a student in a course in the CS department, you have such a need.&nbsp; The application form for you to fill out is linked to the second step at the bottom of <a href="https://portal.mountunion.edu/campusoffice/information_technology/Pages/VPN.aspx" target="_blank"> this web page</a>.&nbsp; The approval process may take a couple of days, and you will not receive an reply message telling you that you have been granted access.&nbsp; Contact <a href="mailto:cindricbb@mountunion.edu"> Prof. Cindric via e-mail</a> if your VPN access isn't working after a few business days and he will work with the IT staff to hopefully work out any problems.
		 </li> <br/><br/>
	  
	     <li> Once you have been approved, you need to install the GlobalProtect software that enables VPN connections to our network on your computer.&nbsp; <a href="https://portal.mountunion.edu/campusoffice/information_technology/Pages/VPN.aspx" target="_blank"> The instructions for doing this are here</a> in the third step at the bottom of the web page; there are separate instructions for Windows computers or Macs.
		 </li> <br/><br/>
	  
	     <li> You only need to install the GlobalProtect software once; after that, you use it to connect to Mount Union's network.&nbsp; The instructions are part of the documentation that you used to install the software in the previous item in this list.
		 </li> <br/><br/>
		 
	     <li> Once you are connected to the campus network via GlobalConnect, you can use a web browser to access the <a href="accessCSVDI.html" target="_blank"> CS Lab Virtual Desktop</a>.
		 </li> <br/><br/>
	  
  </ol>
