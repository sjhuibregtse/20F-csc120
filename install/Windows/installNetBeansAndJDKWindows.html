  <h2>Download and Install NetBeans 12 for Windows</h2>
  
  <!--p>
  Java and NetBeans are free.
  Your computer probably already has a version of the Java runtime (the JRE),
  but it probably does not have a version of the JDK (Java Development Kit),
  which you need for NetBeans.
  </p-->
  
  <!--h3>Windows</h3-->
  
  <!--p>
  You may want to first remove the Java runtime software from your computer,
  then install the Java JDK with NetBeans bundle. The bundle installation
  will install the latest version of Java runtime, the latest version of Java JDK,
  and the NetBeans development environment all in one step.
  </p-->
  
  <!--p>
  You don't have to uninstall the existing version of the JRE.
  If you leave the existing JRE (Java Runtime Environment) on your computer,
  and install the bundle, it will install the new version in addition to the old one,
  and NetBeans will use the new one.
  </p-->
  
  <h3> First step:&nbsp; install OpenJDK11 on your computer:</h3>

	<br /><br />

  <ol type="A">
  
    <li>Click on this link to the file <a href="installNetBeans12.zip" target="_blank">installNetBeans12.zip</a> and choose "Save File..." to download the file to your computer.&nbsp; Be patient, this file is a little larger than the last one....
	<br /><br />

	<br /><br />
    </li>
    
  </ol>
  
  <h3> Third step:&nbsp; verify that Apache NetBeans will launch on your computer:</h3>
  
  <ol type="A">
  
    <li>The NetBeans installer adds <b>Apache Netbeans IDE 12.0</b> to the list of apps that you can launch, and it also creates a desktop icon that you can use to start the IDE.&nbsp; Use either of those approaches to launch NetBeans for the first time.
	<br /><br />
    </li>
    
    <li>The first time you launch the program, there is some addtional set-up that needs to happen.&nbsp; When the <b>Apache NetBeans IDE 12.0</b> window appears, a <b>NetBeans IDE Installer</b> dialog box will pop up on screen:<br/><br/>
	<img src="VerifyNetBeansStepB.png"/ width="400" height="360">
	<br/><br>
	Click <b>Next</b>, check the box saying that you accept the terms in all of the license agreements, and click <b>Install</b>.&nbsp; When the install process has completed, click <b>Finish</b>.
	<br /><br />
    </li>
    
    <li>The NetBeans program window should look something like this:<br/><br/>
	<img src="VerifyNetBeansStepC.png"/ <!--width="400" height="360"-->>
	<br/><br>
	Congratulations -- you are ready to run NetBeans 12.0 on your computer!

  <!--h3>Macintosh</h3>
  
  <p>
  Oracle is the source for all versions of Java for Linux and Windows, but not for Macintosh.
  Only Apple provides versions of Java for Macintosh.
  For a Mac you'll have to first install the JDK from Apple, and then install
  NetBeans from NetBeans.
  </p>
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>Go to <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/" target="_blank">http://support.apple.com/downloads/</a><br /><br />
